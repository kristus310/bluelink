## ⚠️​IT IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT AND CURRENTLY NOT WORKING AS IT SHOULD⚠️ ​
 - BlueLink is a cross-platform desktop app made for transfering files via the Bluetooth protocol.
 - Technologies used: *Java*, *Java Swing* and [BlueCove](https://github.com/hcarver/bluecove) library!
 - It is made on JDK 8 for x32 bit architecture, because the [BlueCove](https://github.com/hcarver/bluecove) library,
   because the library is older than me and doesn't support x64 bit architecture *:D*.
